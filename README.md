# Factory system and analysis

### Program Summary <hr />

My program attempt to model the costs of running a factory. The project
contains a basic generic Factory, alongside two specialized subclasses:
CarFactory and ChipFactory, each with their own unique expenses. The
TESTING configuration verifies the functionality of the various Factory
classes, along with another Employee class of which many are contained in a 
Factory object. The main method gathers this information via file or user input, along with revenues,
and sees whether the operation is profitable. The program is written in C++, and
no additional installations are necessary.

Code is entirely authored by myself; I used a little help from StackOverflow to
figure out C++'s random library. 

### Future Features <hr /> 

In the future, I'd like to add additional types of Factories and Employees
to better model the real-world operation of a particular factory. This
would allow my analysis to be more dynamic and accurate.

Graph outputs comparing the profitability of one or more factories over
a specified amount of time might be a useful addition as well.
